# moov-io/imagecashletter

Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

ImageCashLetter implements a reader, writer, and validator for X9’s Specifications for [Image Cash Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_21_Act) (ICL) to provide Check 21 services in an HTTP server and Go library. The HTTP server is available in a [Docker image](#docker) and the Go package `github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter` is available.

## Project status

Moov ImageCashLetter is actively used in multiple production environments. Please star the project if you are interested in its progress. If you have layers above ImageCashLetter to simplify tasks, perform business operations, or found bugs we would appreciate an issue or pull request. Thanks!

## Usage
The Image Cash Letter project implements an HTTP server and [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter) for creating and modifying ICL files. We also have some [examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter/examples) of the reader and writer.

### Docker

We publish a [public Docker image `moov/imagecashletter`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/imagecashletter/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8083` and metrics at `:9093/metrics` in Prometheus format. We also have Docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/imagecashletter?tab=tags) published as `quay.io/moov/imagecashletter`.

Pull & start the Docker image:
```
docker pull moov/imagecashletter:latest
docker run -p 8083:8083 -p 9093:9093 moov/imagecashletter:latest
```

List files stored in-memory:
```
curl localhost:8083/files
```
```
null
```

Upload an x9 file (binary):
```
curl -X POST --data-binary "@./test/testdata/valid-ascii.x937" http://localhost:8083/files/create
```
```
{"id":"<YOUR-UNIQUE-FILE-ID>","fileHeader":{"id":"","standardLevel":"03","testIndicator":"T","immediateDestination":"061000146","immediateOrigin":"026073150", ...
```

Retrieve an existing x9 file (JSON):
```
curl http://localhost:8083/files/<YOUR-UNIQUE-FILE-ID>
```
```
{"id":"<YOUR-UNIQUE-FILE-ID>","fileHeader":{"id":"","standardLevel":"03","testIndicator":"T","immediateDestination":"061000146","immediateOrigin":"026073150", ...
```

Create an x9 file from JSON:
```
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" localhost:8083/files/create --data @./test/testdata/icl-valid.json
```
```
{"id":"<YOUR-UNIQUE-FILE-ID>","fileHeader":{"id":"","standardLevel":"35","testIndicator":"T","immediateDestination":"231380104","immediateOrigin":"121042882", ...
```

Get the formatted file:
```
curl localhost:8083/files/<YOUR-UNIQUE-FILE-ID>/contents
```
```

### Google Cloud Run

To get started in a hosted environment you can deploy this project to the Google Cloud Platform.

From your [Google Cloud dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) create a new project and call it:
```
moov-icl-demo
```

Enable the [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) API for your project and associate a [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) if needed. Then, open the Cloud Shell terminal and run the following Docker commands, substituting your unique project ID:

```
docker pull moov/imagecashletter
docker tag moov/imagecashletter gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/imagecashletter
docker push gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/imagecashletter
```

Deploy the container to Cloud Run:
```
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/imagecashletter --port 8083
```

Select your target platform to `1`, service name to `imagecashletter`, and region to the one closest to you (enable Google API service if a prompt appears). Upon a successful build you will be given a URL where the API has been deployed:

```
https://YOUR-ICL-APP-URL.a.run.app
```

Now you can list files stored in-memory:
```
curl https://YOUR-ICL-APP-URL.a.run.app/files
```
You should get this response:
```
null
```


### Configuration settings

The following environmental variables can be set to configure behavior in ImageCashLetter.

| Environmental Variable | Description | Default |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `READER_BUFFER_SIZE` | Size of buffer to use with `bufio.Scanner`. | Check `bufio.MaxScanTokenSize` |
| `HTTPS_CERT_FILE` | Filepath containing a certificate (or intermediate chain) to be served by the HTTP server. Requires all traffic be over secure HTTP. | Empty |
| `HTTPS_KEY_FILE`  | Filepath of a private key matching the leaf certificate from `HTTPS_CERT_FILE`. | Empty |
| `FRB_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`  | If set, enables Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) compatibility mode. | Empty |

### Data persistence
By design, ImageCashLetter  **does not persist** (save) any data about the files or entry details created. The only storage occurs in memory of the process and upon restart ImageCashLetter will have no files or data saved. Also, no in-memory encryption of the data is performed.

### Go library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) and Go v1.18 or newer. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

```
$ git@github.com:moov-io/imagecashletter.git

# Pull down into the Go Module cache
$ go get -u github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter

$ go doc github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter CashLetter
```

The package [`github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter) offers a Go-based Image Cash Letter file reader and writer. To get started, check out a specific example:

 ICL File | Read | Write |
|---------|------|-------|
| [Link](examples/imagecashletter-read/iclFile.x937) | [Link](examples/imagecashletter-read/main.go) | [Link](examples/imagecashletter-write/main.go) |

ImageCashLetter's file handling behaviors can be modified to accommodate your specific use case. This is done by passing _options_ into ICL's `reader` and `writer` during instantiation. For example, to read EBCDID encoded files you would instantiate a reader with `NewReader(fd, ReadVariableLineLengthOption(), ReadEbcdicEncodingOption())`.

The following options are currently supported:
| Option | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `ReadVariableLineLengthOption` | Allows Reader to split ICL files based on the Inserted Length Field. |
| `ReadEbcdicEncodingOption` | Allows Reader to decode scanned lines from EBCDIC to UTF-8. |
| `WriteVariableLineLengthOption` | Instructs the Writer to begin each record with the appropriate Inserted Length Field. |
| `WriteEbcdicEncodingOption` | Allows Writer to write file in EBCDIC. |


### In-browser ICL file parser
Using our [in-browser utility](http://oss.moov.io/x9/), you can instantly convert X9 files into JSON. Either paste in ICL file content directly or choose a file from your local machine. This tool is particularly useful if you're handling sensitive PII or want to perform some quick tests, as operations are fully client-side with nothing stored in memory. We plan to support bidirectional conversion in the near future.
