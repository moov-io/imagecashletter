Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Moov ImageCashLetter implements a low-level Image Cash Letter (ICL) interface for parsing, creating, and validating ICL files. Moov ImageCashLetter exposes an HTTP API for REST-based interaction. Any language that can use HTTP and JSON can leverage the ImageCashLetter Server. The API's endpoints expose both text and JSON to easily ingest or export either format.
