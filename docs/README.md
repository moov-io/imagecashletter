## Moov ImageCashLetter

**[GitHub](https://github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter)** | **[Running](https://github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter#usage)** | **[Configuration](https://github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter#configuration-settings)**

### Purpose

Moov ImageCashLetter implements a low-level Image Cash Letter (ICL) interface for parsing, creating, and validating ICL files. Moov ImageCashLetter exposes an HTTP API for REST-based interaction. Any language that can use HTTP and JSON can leverage the ImageCashLetter Server. The API's endpoints expose both text and JSON to easily ingest or export either format.

## Running Moov ImageCashLetter Server

Moov ImageCashLetter can be deployed in multiple scenarios.

- <a href="#binary-distribution">Binary Distributions</a> are released with every versioned release. These are frequently added to the VM/AMI build script for applications needing Moov ICL.
- A <a href="#docker-container">Docker container</a> is built and added to Docker Hub with every versioned release.
- Our hosted [api.moov.io](https://api.moov.io) is updated with every versioned release. Our Kubernetes example is what Moov utilizes in our production environment.

### Binary Distribution

Download the [latest Moov ImageCashLetter server release](https://github.com/moov-io/imagecashletter/releases) for your operating system and run it from a terminal.

```sh
$ ./imagecashletter-darwin-amd64
ts=2019-06-20T23:23:44.870717Z caller=main.go:75 startup="Starting imagecashletter server version v0.2.0"
ts=2019-06-20T23:23:44.871623Z caller=main.go:135 transport=HTTP addr=:8083
ts=2019-06-20T23:23:44.871692Z caller=main.go:125 admin="listening on :9093"
```

### Docker Container

Moov ImageCashLetter is dependent on Docker being properly installed and running on your machine. Ensure that Docker is running. If your Docker client has issues connecting to the service, review the [Docker getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

```sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

Execute the Docker run command:

```sh
$ docker run -p 8083:8083 -p 9093:9093 moov/imagecashletter:latest
ts=2019-06-21T17:03:23.782592Z caller=main.go:69 startup="Starting imagecashletter server version v0.2.0"
ts=2019-06-21T17:03:23.78314Z caller=main.go:129 transport=HTTP addr=:8083
ts=2019-06-21T17:03:23.783252Z caller=main.go:119 admin="listening on :9093"
```

### Kubernetes

The following snippet runs the ImageCashLetter Server on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) in the `apps` namespace. You can reach the ImageCashLetter instance at the following URL from inside the cluster.

```
# Needs to be ran from inside the cluster
$ curl http://imagecashletter.apps.svc.cluster.local:8083/ping
PONG
```

Kubernetes manifest - save in a file (`imagecashletter.yaml`) and apply with `kubectl apply -f imagecashletter.yaml`.
