### Purpose

Moov ImageCashLetter implements a low-level Image Cash Letter (ICL) interface for parsing, creating, and validating ICL files. Moov ImageCashLetter exposes an HTTP API for REST-based interaction. Any language that can use HTTP and JSON can leverage the ImageCashLetter Server. The API's endpoints expose both text and JSON to easily ingest or export either format.
