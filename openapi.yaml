          description: ImageData contains the image view. The Image Data generally consists of an image header and the
            image raster data. The image header provides information that is required to interpret the image raster
            data. The image raster data contains the scanned image of the physical item in raster (line by line) format.
            Each scan line comprises a set of concatenated pixels. The image comprises a set of scan lines. The image
            raster data is typically compressed to reduce the number of bytes needed to transmit and store the image.
            The header/image format type is defined by the ImageViewDetail.ImageViewFormatIndicator. The syntax and
            semantics of the image header/image format are understood by referring to the appropriate image format
            specification. The compression scheme used to compress the image raster data is specified in the
            ImageViewCompressionAlgorithmIdentifier and in the image header portion of the Image Data or by
            association with the selected image format.
            The data may be provided in standard Base64 encoding and will be decoded on file generation.
