              ImageReferenceKeyIndicator identifies whether ImageReferenceKeyLength contains a variable value within the
              allowable range, or contains a defined value and the content is ItemReferenceKey.

              * `0` - ImageReferenceKeyIndicator has Defined Value of 0034 and ImageReferenceKey contains the Image
              Reference Key.
              * `1`- ImageReferenceKeyIndicator contains a value other than Value 0034; or ImageReferenceKeyIndicator
              contains Value 0034, which is not a Defined Value, and the content of ImageReferenceKey has no special
              significance with regards to an Image Reference Key; or ImageReferenceKeyIndicator is 0000, meaning the
              ImageReferenceKey is not present.
